			<p>You need something to communicate with when developing and deploying communication applications. We call these communication end-points. Typically your communication end-point is some form of a communication server to receive and manage your messages. Sometimes this end-point is nothing more than something to test your communication application development against.</p>
			<p>In many cases the communication server does nothing more than forward your message to some other entity. Nowadays that other entity is frequently another user who you are interacting with real time. We call this IM (Instant Messaging). You’ve heard term often and probably are using IM today. Why not have IM and a simultaneous way to transfers files utilizing the same end-point? There are the kinds of capabilities we are working on today. We’re working both within the ECF APIs and the servers that provide this capability.</p>
			<p>The ECF development team has written ECF based communication servers plus developed API access to other publicly available open source communication servers. These ECF servers are available as Java programs you can deploy yourself and in some cases the servers are, or soon will be, available for your use as a communication service.</p>
			<p>Today our list of available communication servers is limited but must useful for current ECF based communication needs. Our list of communication end-point will grow noticeably in the future. Others servers are under development by the ECF committer team. Some communication server applications are waiting on IP licensing issues so we can make them available to you. (Our server applications frequently use the open source work of others. We expect waiting for IP licensing issues to resolve will sometimes be our release or deploy dilemma.)</p>
			<p>Additionally, expect that other developers, utilizing the ECF APIs to provide communication applications, will develop and make available their communication servers. When appropriate and possible, we’ll make information available here about the deployment and use of communication servers developed by others organizations and development teams.</p>
			<p>This communication resources page will grow over time. Here you will find the information on how to deploy ECF developed servers and those available from others. Furthermore the ECF project will make server services available for your ECF communication development utilization and production use.</p>

			<p>The ECF project maintains three servers for communication end-point testing and ECF based communication services. We refer to the servers by the names of:</p>
			<p><b>Eclipse ECF:</b> at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/index.html">Eclipse Foundation</a>, Ottawa, Ontario - Canada</p>
			<p><b>OSU OSL:</b> at <a href="http://osuosl.org">Oregon State University Open Source Lab</a>, Corvallis, Oregon - USA</p>
			<p><b>Intel DuPont:</b> at <a href="http://www.intel.com/cd/ids/developer/asmo-na/eng/18688.htm">Intel® Remote Access Services</a>, DuPont, Washington - USA</p>
			<p>We have an appreciation and special thanks to the above enterprises for hosting and managing the above servers for our ECF communication server needs. If you have an occasion to use these servers we ask that you too express your appreciation, given the opportunity.</p>
			<p>We use these communication servers in a variety of ways. Some are open for semi-public communication services use while others are closed to they can be utilized for communication testing. The closed servers can be made available for testing use based on valid and meaningful proposed needs. In broad terms, we utilize the above three servers, in overlapping functionality, as follows:</p>
			<p><b>Development</b></p>
			<ul>ECF communication servers, where 100% uptime or full functionality is not guaranteed. Server purpose is software development, configuration establishment, and manual intervention protocol testing. Services may be down or partially functional for days at a time. Exclusive ECF committer access only, except for guest contributors where access and services status is managed by one or more ECF committers.</ul>
			<p><b>Comm Testing</b></p>
			<ul>ECF communication servers, where near 100% services uptime and full functionality is expected. Short-term loss of services functionality for testing and evaluation purposes is allowed. Return to normal service operation will normally be a high-priority unless users are notified of the situation and expected service restoration. Exclusive committer access—other access exceptions may occur by written proposal plan and approved by the ECF project lead.</ul>
			<p><b>Build</b></p>
			<ul>Sever(s) designated to run headless builds and code testing for Eclipse plug-in development. Build server is initially deployed for ECF plug-in build and code testing.</ul>
			<p><b>CVS</b></p>
			<ul>SCM (Software Configuration Management) and source code archive for development not ready for general release mostly due to IP licensing issues--ECF release checkout and zip archive via scripting.</ul>
			<p><b>Production & Evaluation</b></p>
			<ul>ECF communication server, where 100% services uptime and full functionality is guaranteed, except when short-term faults or anomalies occur. Loss of server functionality requires high priority restoration. Semi-public access allowed (login required) with limited administrative access by selected ECF team committer members.</ul>
			<p>If you have a communication end-point needs either for ECF development and testing or a production level communication server, send an email request to the <a href="mailto:ecf-dev@eclipse.org">ECF developers mailing list</a>.</p>

	      <p>Located on the ECF servers identified above at the ECF Testing and Communication Servers section the ECF project team maintains following ECF related communication services for ECF development at testing:</p>
				<p><b>ECF Generic Collaboration Server</b></p>
				<ul>
					The main ECF Generic server user features are private collaboration groups that are connected to resources in the Eclipse workspace, and within those groups: chat, peer file sharing, enhanced Eclipse presence info, URL sharing, and remote Eclipse view opening.
					The ECF Generic Collaboration Server also provides dynamically adding arbitrary new components (shared objects).  This is a huge developer feature (as opposed to user feature).
				</ul>
				<p><b>Jive Messenger XMPP (Jabber) Server</b></p>
				<ul>
					Jive Messenger is an Open Source Java based server for comprehensive group chat and instant messaging (IM), which is based on the open
					XMPP protocol. See <a href="#install-4">Deploying the Jive Messenger Open Source XMPP (Jabber) Server</a> for more information and downloads.
				</ul>
				<p>See the ECF <a href="NewAndNoteworthy.html">New and Noteworthy</a> page for information on the functional details the above servers provide and how to access via the Eclipse IDE.</p>
				<p>At this time, public access to the above ECF servers is closed until we resolve the LDAP access log-in procedures. We are presently working on the logistics of connecting to a LDAP server for authenticated access to ECF servers. We’ll note here when this access is available.</p>
				<p>If you have an ECF related experimental or evaluation need to access the above ECF communication services, send an email request to the <a href="mailto:ecf-dev@eclipse.org">ECF developers mailing list</a>. You can also deploy your own ECF servers as discussed in the <a href="#dev-testing">Installing and Configuring ECF Communication Servers for Development Testing</a> section of this page.</p>

	  This example configures a server that listens on port 3282, with hostname "localhost", and supporting a single group named "server".
	  This corresponds to the following client URL:  <b>ecftcp://localhost:3282/server</b>.
	  <p></p>
	  Note that if the <b>hostname</b> attribute is omitted, the hostname will default to the fully qualified
	  domain name of the given machine (e.g. www.eclipse.org).
	  <p></p>
	  Note also that there can be as many groups as
	  desired defined within a given port/connector,
	  and each group will define a unique url.  For example for group name="server1", or group name="server2",
	  the URLS would be:  ecftcp://localhost:3282/server1, ecftcp://localhost:3282/server2, respectively.
