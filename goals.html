    <td>The goal of the ECF Project is to provide an open source framework to
      support the creation of communications applications on the Eclipse platform.
      The framework will consist of Eclipse plugins that provide high-level APIs
      to support asynchronous and real-time messaging for human-to-human, human-to-component,
      and component-to-component communications and collaboration.<br><br>
	  <strong>Note:</strong> see <a href="documentation.html">ECF Documentation</a> for description of ECF capability.

    <td><p>A wide variety of Eclipse applications will be easily creatable within
        this framework: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Human Communication and Collaboration:</b> Instant Messaging,
          Chat, Application Sharing, File Sharing, Video/Audio Conferencing,
          others </li>
        <li><b>Communication with Web and Peer-Based Services:</b> Access to
          web-based services via the Eclipse platform such as Weblogs, RSS, Web-based
          Content Creation, Web-based Project Management Systems, others </li>
        <li><b>Component-to-Component Communication:</b> Distributed Modeling,
          Remote Debugging, Team Content Management, Team Workflow Applications,
          others </li>
      </ul>
      <p>As part of the framework develoment and testing, the ECF team will implement
        a reference subset of applications to demonstrate the utility, and usability
        of the framework. We will also work with plugin developers, application
        developers, and the Eclipse community to support the creation of other
        applications that use this framework. Our ultimate goal is that plugin
        developers use and/or extend this framework to allow them to build compelling
        communications applications with the Eclipse platform.

    &nbsp;Technical Goals</font></b></td>

  <tr>
    <td><h4>Communication Components</h4>
      <p>The framework will provide a small set of high-level communications
        abstractions. Rather than provide yet another messaging API, the ECF
        project will look to provide plugin programmers with a component API
        for communications applications so that high-level communications components
        (e.g. real-time IM/chat, presence, file sharing, audio/video conferencing,
        etc) may be reused in multiple application contexts and with multiple
        user interfaces. </p>
      <h4>Interoperability</h4>
      <p>The framework will provide a simple API for accessing multiple IP-based
        protocols, allowing plugin developers to focus on providing application-level
        integration of communications features and the rapid composition of distributed
        applications. </p>
      <p>To allow interoperability with existing servers and clients, ECF APIs
        will provide extension points so that multiple protocols may be plugged
        in to the framework, allowing Eclipse-based applications to interoperate
        with other clients via standard protocols such as XMPP, SIP/SIMPLE and
        others, while also being able to easily support communications with legacy
        and proprietary systems. </p>
      <h4>Security</h4>
      <p>The ECF framework will provide for application-level flexibility in
        the use of authentication, user and component identity, encryption, and
        authentication. The framework will allow third parties to substitute
        alternative open source and/or proprietary implementations of any/all
        of these security mechanisms to support integration with existing security
        systems, and the satisfaction of application-specific security requirements. </p>
      <p>ECF will also provide security mechanisms for authorization and runtime
        restriction of fine-grained components for controlling the behavior of
        potentially untrusted components. </p>
      <h4>Application Extensibility</h4>
      <p>The framework will support the runtime distribution of components and
        dynamic introduction of new protocols to allow for dynamic composition
        of communication and collaboration applications. </p>
      <p>In summary, the major technical goals of ECF will be:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Simple-Yet-General Communications Abstractions:</b> To support
          both peer-to-peer and client-server applications</li>
        <li><b>Interoperability:</b> Through the use of open, layered, replaceable
          protocols</li>
        <li><b>Security:</b> Identity/Authentication, Encryption, and Authorization
          for applications and fine-grained components</li>
        <li><b>Application Extensibility:</b> Via dynamic distribution of components</li>
        <li><b>Component/Plugin Architecture Integrated with Eclipse 3.0:</b> Use
          of the OSGI Component and Service Models Present in Eclipse 3.0</li>
    </ol>
