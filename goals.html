      The goal of the Pollinate project is to build an Eclipse 3.1 based IDE and
      tool set that leverages the open source
      <a target="_top" href="http://incubator.apache.org/beehive/">Apache
      Beehive</a> application framework.
      <a target="_top" href="http://edocs.bea.com/workshop/docs81/doc/en/core/index.html">
      WebLogic Workshop 8.1</a> (WLW) serves as a rough guide as to what
      Pollinate hopes to achieve, although none of the WLW implementation
      (except present in Beehive) will be used in implementing Pollinate.<p>
      Pollinate will provide a full-featured Java development environment that
      enables developers to visually build and assemble enterprise-scale web
      applications, JSPs, web services, and leverage the Java controls framework
      for creating and consuming J2EE components; optimized for a
      service-oriented architecture. This will be accomplished by creating a
      broad set of Eclipse plug-ins and user interface components for building
      projects on top of the Apache Beehive framework. Beehive is an Apache
      open-source project that uses the innovations in JDK 1.5 to help simplify
      programming on J2EE and other Web Application containers.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to deploy Pollinate as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a standalone IDE based upon Eclipse</li>
        <li>an optional feature of an existing Eclipse-based IDE installed via
        the Eclipse 3.1 Update Manager</li>
        <li>a set of plug-ins for an existing Eclipse-based IDE installed via a
        zip file</li>
      </ul>

      Pollinate is focused on technology related to the open source Apache
      Beehive application framework, therefore, by definition, everything else
      is secondary. This means that functionality needed by Pollinate but not
      directly related to Beehive, such as a JSP editor, will probably not be
      built by the Pollinate team. Hopefully we can obtain technology such as a
      JSP editor from outside of the Pollinate Project, or for example, assist
      the Web Tools Project in building it if we have time in our schedule. If
      secondary technology is not available and we don't have time in the
      Pollinate schedule to do it, then we will probably do the simplest thing
      possible, such as, in the case of a JSP editor, just rely on the standard
      Eclipse text editing functionality.<br>

      Pollinate is to WTP as Equinox is to Eclipse.<p>Pollinate is tightly
      focused on delivering a Beehive related toolset where as WTP, like Eclipse
      itself, is much broader and deeper. Anything that Pollinate can reuse from
      WTP, it will. No NIH syndrome here ;-)</p>
      <p>At this early stage of the game I'm not going to assume that WTP will
      adopt any of the work done in Pollinate, but if our work is of good
      quality then I hope that WTP will consider it in the future. Pollinate's
      approach is not to compete with WTP but to explore a toolset related to
      Beehive that may reuse WTP technology when possible. In the future,
      Pollinate might be promoted to a subproject of WTP or the Pollinate
      technology might be incorported into WTP in various places, but first lets
      get started and see how far we get.</td>
