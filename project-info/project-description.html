	    <b>ECF</b> is a set of plugins for supporting the development of distributed Eclipse-based tools and applications.
    The framework can be used to create other plugins, tools, or full <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rcp">Eclipse RCP</a> applications that require
    asynchronous messaging and real-time communications.
    <br/><br/>
    ECF also provides an open distributed component model based upon the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/">Equinox runtime</a>, along with a growing set of extensible communications components.  All APIs, components, and ECF protocol providers may be reused, extended, or replaced by developers.

    <br><br>
    To test and demonstrate the framework, the committers and other community members have built applications with features such as user presence and instant messaging, multi-user chat, file sharing, co-browsing, shared drawing/whiteboard, and real-time collaborative editing.  See <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Eclipse_Communication_Framework_Project">plans and subprojects</a> for efforts currently underway.
