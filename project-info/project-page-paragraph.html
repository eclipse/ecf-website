<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ecf">Eclipse Communication Framework (ECF)</a> is a set of plugins for supporting the development of distributed Eclipse-based tools and applications. The framework can be used to create other plugins, tools, or full Eclipse RCP applications that require asynchronous messaging and real-time communications.</p>
<p>ECF also provides an open distributed component model based upon the Equinox runtime, along with a growing set of extensible communications components. All APIs, components, and ECF protocol providers may be reused, extended, or replaced by developers.</p>
