ECF provides APIs and components for building real-time communications and 
collaboration functionality into plugins.  Developers can use simple-but-extensible messaging APIs,
with open or proprietary protocols to more easily weave communications into their plugins.</p>
<p>ECF also provides exemplary tools and applications that use ECF APIs.  Available example applications 
are Instant Messaging (IM), real-time collaboration features like chat and shared web browsing, 
along with more advanced communications like dynamic service lookup and discovery, 
shared model editing, and remote control.  Voice-Over-IP (VOIP) is also a current and future 
major focus for the project.</p>
<p>
For Eclipse Foundation project teams we provide secure and free communications and collaboration 
services such as private project buddy lists, IM, shared editors, and team chat directly within Eclipse.  
To arrange to use these services for your project team simply send your request to
