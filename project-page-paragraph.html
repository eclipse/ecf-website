ECF provides APIs and high-level components for building real-time communications and 
collaboration functionality into plugins.  Developers can use simple-but-extensible group or point-to-point messaging APIs,
and their own or other's implementations of open or proprietary protocols to 
more easily weave integrated 
communications into their own plugins.</p>
<p>ECF also provides exemplary tools and applications.  Currently available examples are Instant Messaging (IM), 
real-time collaboration features such as chat, shared web browsing, and group file sharing,
dynamic service lookup and discovery, shared editing for arbitary models and documents, 
and remote control.  Voice-over-IP (VOIP) is also a current and future major focus for the 
project.</p>
<p>
For Eclipse Foundation project teams we also provide secure communications and collaboration 
services such as private project buddy lists, IM, and chat.  We also provide some currently basic-but-expanding
real-time collaboration features such as team co-browsing, remote launching of Eclipse editors, and 
multi-user graphical model editors.</p>
