ECF provides APIs and high-level components for building real-time messaging and 
collaboration into plugins.  Developers can use simple-but-extensible group or point-to-point messaging APIs,
their own or other's implementations of open or proprietary protocols, and application-level componentry to 
more easily weave integrated 
communications into their own tools and applications.</p>
<p>ECF also provides working exemplary tools and applications.  Currently available examples are Instant Messaging (IM), 
real-time collaboration features such as chat, shared web browsing, and group file sharing,
dynamic service lookup and discovery, shared editing for arbitary models and documents, 
and remote control.  Voice-over-IP (VOIP) is also a current and future major technical focus for the 
project.</p>
