ECF provides APIs and high-level components for building real-time messaging and 
collaboration into Eclipse or Rich Client Platform (RCP) plugins.  Developers can use simple-but-extensible APIs,
open implementations of open protocols, and open-source application-level componentry to weave integrated 
communications into their own tools and applications.</p>
<p>ECF also provides working exemplary tools and applications.  The currently available examples are Instant Messaging (IM), 
real-time collaboration features such as shared web browsing and group file sharing,
dynamic service lookup and discovery, shared editing for arbitary models and documents, 
remote control, and file sharing.  Voice-over-IP (VOIP) is also a current and future major technical focus for the 
project.</p>
