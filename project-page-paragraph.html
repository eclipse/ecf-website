<p><b><a href="/ecf/">ECF - Eclipse Communication Framework</a></b><br/>
ECF provides APIs and high-level components for building real-time messaging and 
collaboration directly into Eclipse or Rich Client Platform (RCP) plugins.  Developers can use the extensible APIs and/or the 
application-level componentry to more easily build integrated communications directly into their tools and applications.</p>
<p>Exemplary tools and applications are also available including Instant Messaging (IM), real-time collaboration features,
dynamic service lookup and discovery, shared editing features, and file sharing.  Voice-over-IP (VOIP) is also currently a major focus for the 
project.</p>
