<p><b><a href="/ecf/">ECF - Eclipse Communication Framework</a></b><br/>
ECF provides APIs and high-level components for building real-time communications and 
collaboration functionality into plugins.  Developers can use simple-but-extensible messaging APIs,
with open or proprietary protocols to more easily weave integrated communications into their plugins.</p>
<p>ECF also provides exemplary tools, applications, and services using these APIs.  Currently available example applications 
are Instant Messaging (IM), real-time collaboration features like chat and shared web browsing, 
along with more advanced communications like dynamic service lookup and discovery, 
shared model editing, and remote control.  Voice-Over-IP (VOIP) is also a current and future major focus for the 
project.</p>
<p>
For Eclipse Foundation project teams we provide secure communications and collaboration 
services such as private project buddy lists, IM, and chat.  To arrange to use these services for 
your project team simpley send your request to <a href="mailto:ecf-dev@eclipse.org">ecf-dev@eclipse.org</a></p>
