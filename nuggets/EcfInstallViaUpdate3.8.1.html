     For a detailed step-by-step description of how to install OSGi Remote Services into Eclipse 
     see <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Installing_OSGi_Remote_Services#Install_into_Eclipse">Installing Into Eclipse</a>.  For a 
     step-by-step description of how to add OSGi Remote Services into your <b>Target Platform</b> see 
     <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Installing_OSGi_Remote_Services">Add to Target Platform</a>.
     <p>
      <ul>
       <li>In Eclipse, choose <b>Help -> Install New Software...</b></li>
       <li>Click on the <b>Add</b> button on the right. </li>
       <li>Type in a Name in the textbox. For example, type: <b>ECF 3.8.1</b>.</li>
       
       <li>Paste the following URL into the Location field. <br><br>
       <b>http://download.eclipse.org/rt/ecf/3.8.1/site.p2</b></li>
       <li> Click OK. </li>
       
       <li>Select the first <b>two</b> check boxes for install into Eclipse..i.e.
       <b>ECF OSGi Remote Services/Remote Service Admin SDK</b> and the <b>ECF SDK for Eclipse</b>.
       To explain:  The ECF repository has four top-level items for install:  </li>
       <ol>
       <li><b>ECF OSGi Remote Services SDK</b></li>
       <li><b>ECF Patch for Eclipse Kepler (4.3).  Not needed for Eclipse Luna (4.4).</b></li>
       <li><b>ECF SDK for Eclipse</b></li>
       <li><b>ECF Supplemental File Transfer Providers</b></li>
       </ol>
       <p>
       <b>PLEASE NOTE:  If you are installing ECF into to Eclipse Kepler (4.3)</b> you must check the item <b>ECF Patch for Eclipse Kepler (4.3)</b>...in addition to any other items</b>.  
       If, however, you are installing into Eclipse Luna (4.4), <b>you must not check this item</b>.
       <p>
       You should generally select the <b>first two</b> of these (ECF OSGi Remote Services SDK and the ECF SDK for Eclipse) to get all of the
       OSGi Remote Services and Eclipse-based ECF plugins.   If you are only interested in OSGi Remote Services (e.g. for OSGi server-based work with remote services), you may choose to only
       install the ECF OSGi Remote Services SDK and not the entire ECF SDK for Eclipse.   It should generally not be necessary to install the ECF Supplemental File Transfer Providers.
       <p>
       Of course, you may also uncheck the <b>Group items by category</b> checkbox and choose the individual ECF features ala carte to get only the parts of ECF that you wish.
       <li>Click on Next.
       
       <li>Follow through the remaining dialogs to complete the installation.</li>
      </ul>
     <p>
     To uninstall ECF SDK...
     <ul>
     <li>Choose <b>Help -> Install New Software...</b></li>
     <li>Click on <b>already installed</b> (lower part of install manager dialog)</li>
     <li>Click on <b>Installed Software tab</b></li>
     <li>Click on <b>ECF SDK</b></li>
     <li>Click on <b>Uninstall ...</b></li>
     </ul>
     </p>
