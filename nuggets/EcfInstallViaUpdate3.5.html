    <h3><a name="2.0.0M6">ECF 3.0 Install via P2 Repository -- <b>for use with Eclipse 3.5</b></a></h3>
     <p>
     <b>NOTE</b>:  For Eclipse 3.5/Galileo, you <b>must</b> use this update site and not the other update sites
     given below.  These instructions have been tested with Eclipse 3.5M7.
     <p>
      <ul>
       <li>In Eclipse 3.5/Galileo, choose <b>Help -> Install New Software...</b>
       
       </li>
       <li>Click on the <b>Add</b> button.
       </li>
       
       <li>Type in the following URL into the Location Textbox. For some versions of Eclipse, you can
       drag and drop the following URL from your browser to the Location textbox. 
       <br/>
       <b><a href="http://download.eclipse.org/rt/ecf/integration/v20090527-0800/repo">http://download.eclipse.org/rt/ecf/integration/v20090527-0800/repo</a></b>
       </li>
       
       <li>Type in a name in the Name textbox. For example, type ECF.
       </li>
       
       <li> Click OK. </li>
       
       <li>Select the Eclipse Communication Framework (ECF). </li>
       
       <li>Click on Next.</li>
       
       <li>Follow through the remaining dialog to complete the installation.</li>
      </ul>
     <p>
     To uninstall ECF ...
     <ul>
     <li>Choose <b>Help -> Install New Software...</b></li>
     <li>Click on <b>already installed</b> </li>
     <li>Click on <b>Installed Software</b></li>
     <li>Click on <b>Eclipse Communication Framework (SDK)</b></li>
     <li>Click on <b>Uninstall ...</b></li>
     </ul>
     </p>
     <p>
     The method described above uses the new P2 update mechanism. Eclipse by default does not enable the classic 
     update mechanism, but you can do that manually. To do so, go to <b>Preferences ...</b>. On the Mac, this is
     under the <b>Eclipse</b> menu. Then, go to <b>General -> Capabilities</b> and click on Classic Update. Note, however,
     that this method does not automatically take care of prerequisites for you. If you use the classic method to install ECF
     on a freshly installed Eclipse, you will most likely get an error message that tells you what you must install
     before the ECF installation can be successful.
