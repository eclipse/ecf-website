    <h3><a name="2.0.0M6">ECF 3.3/Helios Install -- <b>for use with Eclipse Helios (3.6) or Galileo (3.5.X)</b></a></h3>
     <p>
     <b>Note</b>:  ECF is part of the Helios Release Train, and as such is available via Helios repository, which is built into Eclipse.  You can 
     access this repository by going to <b>Help -> Install New Software...->Work With (select Helios from 
     combo box)</b>.  Then under <b>Eclipse Runtime Target Platform Components</b> find <b>Eclipse Communication Framework Target Components</b> to install.
     </p>
     <p>
     Below is the procedure to install ECF via the ECF Repository directly (rather than the Helios repository as described above).
     </p>
     <p>
      <ul>
       <li>In Eclipse, choose <b>Help -> Install New Software...</b></li>
       <li>Click on the <b>Add</b> button on the right. </li>
       <li>Type in a Name in the textbox. For example, type: <b>ECF 3.3/Helios</b>.</li>
       
       <li>Paste the following URL into the Location field. <br/>
       <b>http://download.eclipse.org/rt/ecf/3.3/helios/site.p2</b></li>
       <li> Click OK. </li>
       
       <li>Select the Eclipse Communication Framework (ECF) check box.  NOTE:  This check box will result in including 4 sub-items 
       
       <ol>
       <li><b>ECF 3.3 Patch for Eclipse 3.5.X</b></li>
       <li><b>Eclipse Communication Framework Target Components</b></li>
       <li><b>Source for ECF 3.3 Patch for Eclipse 3.5.X</b></li>
       <li><b>Source for Eclipse Communication Framework Target Components</b></li>
       </ol>
       <b>Under normal conditions, all four of these sub-items should be included/selected for install.</b>.  The <b>ECF 3.3 Patch for Eclipse 3.5.X</b> is necessary because part of ECF is included with the
       Eclipse platform itself, and this patch will update these relatively old bundles that were installed with Eclipse 3.5.X.  The source code for the ECF can be removed, but *both* the <b>ECF 3.3 Patch for Eclipse 3.5.X</b> and the <b>Eclipse Communication Framework Target Components</b> must be installed to properly use ECF 3.3</li>
       
       <li>Click on Next.</li>
       
       <li>Follow through the remaining dialogs to complete the installation.</li>
      </ul>
     <p>
     To uninstall ECF ...
     <ul>
     <li>Choose <b>Help -> Install New Software...</b></li>
     <li>Click on <b>already installed</b> </li>
     <li>Click on <b>Installed Software</b></li>
     <li>Click on <b>Eclipse Communication Framework Target Components</b></li>
     <li>Click on <b>Uninstall ...</b></li>
     </ul>
     </p>
