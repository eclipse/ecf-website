	<h3>Installing ECF SDK into Eclipse with Bndtools 7.1 (Recommended)</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="https://bndtools.org/">Bndtools</a> is a set of Eclipse plugins to simplify the creation, development, testing, and deployment of OSGi bundles. 
			We recommend that Bndtools be installed into <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a> prior to installing our Remote Services SDK.  ECF's
			SDK now has support for Bndtools' Workspace, Project, and Launch templates for Remote Services development, and adds Remote Service Creation Wizards, built upon new Bndtools' Service Templates.
		</p>
		<p>
			See the <a href="https://bndtools.org/installation.html">Bndtools Installation</a> to install Bndtools 7.1+ into a new or recently installed <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a>.
