             <b>Releases</b><br/>
             Releases are builds that have been declared major releases by the ECF development
             team - for example &quot;R1.0&quot;. Releases are the right builds for people
             who want to be on a stable, tested release, and don't need the latest greatest
             features and improvements. Release builds always have an &quot;R&quot; at the
             beginning of the name i.e. R1.0, R2.0 etc. Non-release builds are named according
             to the date of the build - for example 20050710 is the build from July 10, 2005.

            <b>Integration Builds</b><br/>
            Periodically, component teams version off their work in what they believe is
            a stable, consistent state, and they update the build configuration to indicate
            that the next integration build should take this version of the component.
            Integration builds are built from these stable component versions that have been
            specified by each component team as the best version available. Integration
            builds may be promoted to stable builds after a few days of testing. Integration
            builds are built whenever new stable component versions are released into the build.

            <b>Nightly Builds</b><br/>
            Nightly builds are produced over night from whatever has been released into the
            HEAD stream of the CVS repository. They are completely untested and will almost
            always have major problems. Many will not work at all. These drops are normally
            only useful to developers actually working on the ECF project.<br/> <br/>
            Note: Nightly builds are produced only as requested, and not necessarily every
            night, by developers to build what was in HEAD.

          <b>Maintenance Builds</b><br/>
          Periodically builds for maintenance of the current release will be performed.
          They will not necessarily be stable builds. When the maintenace is finalized and
          released, it will be moved up to a Release build. If the build name starts with
          an &quot;M&quot; i.e. M200500810,then it has not been tested for stability. If it
          is a release candidate, i.e. 0.5.0.1RC1, then it is a stable maintenance build.
