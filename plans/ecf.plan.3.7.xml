	<compatibility_with_previous_releases>
		<html:div>
			<html:p>
				ECF has a policy of maintaining API backward compatibility with
				minor and service releases. API is considered all
				exported packages (i.e. packages that do not have
				<html:pre>x-internal:=true</html:pre>
				in their Export-Package declaration. As an example,
				with the following declaration in the org.eclipse.ecf MANIFEST.MF
			</html:p>
			<html:pre>Export-Package: org.eclipse.ecf.core,
				org.eclipse.ecf.internal.core;x-internal:=true
       </html:pre>
			<html:p>The org.eclipse.ecf.core package is API, and the
				org.eclipse.ecf.internal.core package is not</html:p>
			<html:p>Only with major releases (e.g. 2.0.0, 3.0.0) are incompatible
				API changes to be introduced (e.g. refactorings, renames), and even
				then only after discussion
				among multiple committers. For the parts of ECF used by the Platform
				(e.g. the core and file transfer bundles), NO incompatible
				API changes will be introduced, even for major releases, in order to
				maintain the platform backward compatibility
				constraints.</html:p>
