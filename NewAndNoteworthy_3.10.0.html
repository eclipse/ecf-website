					<b>Remote Services Tooling</b>

			</td>
			<td valign="top" width="85%"><p>A theme for ECF in the Mars SR Cycle has been the creation of new Tooling to support development, debugging, and deployment
			of <a href="">ECF Remote Services</a>.  This <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=454609">ongoing community effort</a> includes 
			in this release a new Remote Service perspective.  
			<p>
			<img src="images/screens/remoteserviceperspective1.png">
			</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>
			Once the Remote Service perspective is opened, it shows the new Endpoint Discovery view (lower left).  The Endpoint Discovery view will be dynamically updated to display Endpoints 
			that have been discovered via network discovery (i.e. using ECF-supported network protocols like zeroconf, slp, zookeeper, dnssd, etcd, or custom).  To the right of the Endpoint
			Discovery View is the Eclipse-standard Properties view to display the properties present in the selected Endpoint.  To the right of
			the Properties view is the Eclipse-PDE-provided Plug-in Registry, which can be used to show Remote Services that have been imported.  Note that the Plugin-Registry
			defaults to grouping the presentation based upon Plugins rather than Services, and so should be set to Group By/Services view the view menu to display
			the OSGi Services currently active in Eclipse.
			</p>
			<p>
			<img src="images/screens/remoteserviceperspective2.png">
			</p>
			<p>
			Discovered Endpoints can be Imported into Eclipse by opening the Endpoint's context menu.  Importing the Endpoint means that ECF creates and locally registers a proxy for the remote service, allowing application 
			code to actually use the remote service (call it's methods).   As shown below, the Plugin Registry and the Endpoint Discovery view are graphically updated to show
			that the Remote Service is currently active in the Eclipse Framework, and that the Endpoint has been imported.

					<b>Support for OSGi R6 Remote Service and Remote Service Admin (1.1) Specifications</b>

			</td>
			<td valign="top" width="85%">
				<p>ECF provides a compliant and CT-test implementation of <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECF#OSGi_Remote_Services">OSGi Remote Services</a>
				and <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Remote_Services_Admin">Remote Services Admin</a>.  In <a href="http://www.osgi.org/Release6/HomePage">OSGi R6 specification</a> work
				done in early 2014, the <a href="http://www.osgi.org/EEG/HomePage">Enterprise Experts Group (EEG)</a> made additions
				and some small changes to the Remote Service Admin specification (v1.1).  Remote Services is specified in Chapter 100 of the enterprise specification,
				and Remote Service Admin in Chapter 122 of the specification.  You can download the R6 enterprise specification at the <a href="http://www.osgi.org/Release6/HomePage">OSGi web site</a>.<p>
				<p>
				With this 3.9.0 release, ECF's implementation is fully compliant with the OSGi R6 Remote Service and Remote
				Service Admin (1.1) specifications.  This includes testing against the OSGi R6 Compatibilty Test suite for remote services/remote service admin 
				parts of the specification.
